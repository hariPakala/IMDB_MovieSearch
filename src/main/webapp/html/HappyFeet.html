Correction Appended
The feet in the title of George Millerâ€™s new film shuffle and stomp with glorious syncopation, but it would be a stretch to call them happy. Small and webbed and clawed, the appendages belong to an animated emperor penguin named Mumble (Elijah Wood) who, through the wizardry of computer animation, gets his terpsichorean moves from the brilliant tap-dancer Savion Glover. Like Mr. Glover and Eleanor Powell, Mumble was born to dance. </h:body></html>
